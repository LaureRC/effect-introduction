# Introduction to Effect

This repository was created to share the slides and the code I used for [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfQaG1fL-F0).

The main objective of the talk was to give a simple introduction to Effect, and show how it can help you with handling errors, data validation, concurrency, and more!

## Live coding exercise

You can find the code I used for the live coding part of the talk in the file `liveCoding.ts`. The solutions for each step of the exercise are listed in the `liveCodingSolutions` folder.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run the live coding exercise:

```bash
bun run liveCoding.ts
```

_This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.38. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime._

## Slides

The slides are available here: https://effect-introduction.vercel.app/

Or you can run them locally:

```bash
